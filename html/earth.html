                                <p>Earth is made up of complex, interactive systems that create a constantly changing world that we are striving to understand. From the vantage point of space, we are able to observe our planet globally, using sensitive instruments to understand the delicate balance among its oceans, air, land, and life. NASA satellite observations help study and predict weather, drought, pollution, climate change, and many other phenomena that affect the environment, economy, and society.<br><br>

                                    The first spacecraft to visit Mercury was NASA's Mariner 10, which imaged about 45% of the surface. NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft flew by Mercury three times and orbited the planet for four years before crashing on its surface at the end of its mission.<br><br>

The European Space Agency and JAXA launched a joint mission to Mercury in 2018. The mission, called BepiColombo, is made up of two spacecraft. ESA built the main spacecraft, the Mercury Planetary Orbiter, and JAXA supplied the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter.<br><br>

BepiColombo captured its first views of Mercury during a flyby on Oct. 1, 2021. A total of nine flybys are planned to help steer the spacecraft into orbit in late 2025. It will begin its primary science mission in early 2026.<br><br>

                              Twenty-four humans have traveled from the Earth to the Moon. Twelve walked on its surface. The last human visited the lunar surface in 1972.</p>
